  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2, 2026</p>

  <p>
    This application is built as an ad-supported app and is provided at no cost.
    It is intended to be used as-is by technicians.
  </p>

  <p>
    This page informs users about our policies regarding the collection, use,
    and disclosure of information when using the Service.

  <p>
    By using this Service, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

  <p>
    This app does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or request any personally
    identifiable information from users.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>No user accounts or login are required</li>
    <li>No personal data is saved on our servers</li>
    <li>No usage tracking or profiling is performed by us</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The app is designed only to display error code information for technical
    reference.
  </p>

  <h2>Advertising & Third-Party Services</h2>

  <p>
    To support the app and keep it free, advertisements are displayed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The app may use third-party advertising services (such as Google AdMob).
    These services may collect non-personal information such as device type,
    advertising ID, or basic usage data in order to serve ads, according to
    their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <p>
    We do not control, access, or store any data collected by these third-party
    services.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>Log Data</h2>

  <p>
    In case of an app error or crash, third-party tools may automatically collect
    log data to help improve app stability.

    <li>Operating system version</li>
    <li>Time and date of app usage</li>
    <li>App configuration during a crash</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This information is used only for debugging purposes and is not linked to
    any personal identity.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>

  <p>
    This app does not use cookies directly.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, third-party advertising libraries may use cookies or similar
    technologies to improve ad delivery. You can control or limit ad

  </ul>

  <p>
    These service providers are obligated to use the information only to
    perform the tasks assigned to them.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>

  <p>
    Since the app does not collect personal data, there is no personal
    information stored or transmitted by us. While we strive to use reliable
    services, no electronic system can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
  </p>

  <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

  <p>
    This Service may contain links to external websites. These sites are not
    operated by us, and we are not responsible for their content or privacy
    practices. We recommend reviewing their Privacy Policies separately.

    posted on this page. Continued use of the app indicates acceptance of the
    updated policy.
